# SalesAI
A sales assistant bot built atop Amazon Lex, AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB and Python

The bot focuses on helping a salesperson setup his calendar, book a hotel or rent a car for his sales activities. It not only
allows him to be more efficient, but ensures that information is disseminated across the organization seamlessly.

It will also allow his supervisor to keep a note of the sales funnel and ensure that appropriate support is provided at the 
correct time.
